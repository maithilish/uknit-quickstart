# uKnit Quickstart

You are in main/master branch, and there is no project in this branch. Probably the project is cloned without the branch name.

You can fix it by checking out either **maven** or **gradle** branch. Open IDE terminal, run `git checkout maven` (for maven project) or `git checkout gradle` (for gradle project) from project folder and reload the project in IDE.
